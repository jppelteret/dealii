New: Experimental support for simplex meshes (i.e., meshes consisting
of triangle or tetrahedron cells) and mixed meshes (i.e., meshes consisting
of lines, triangles, quadrilateral, tetrahedron, pyramid, wedge, and/or 
hexahedron cells) has been added. The new features are presented 
in the test folder `tests/simplex` and in the 
new "Simplex" module page.
